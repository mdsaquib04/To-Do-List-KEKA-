To enhance the To-Do-List application, we have extended its capabilities to integrate with interfaces outside the core application experience through notifications and app widgets. This ensures users can access and interact with their tasks seamlessly from various points on their devices.

Implemented Features:

Implemented a background task to periodically update the app widget, ensuring that users receive real-time information on their home screen.
